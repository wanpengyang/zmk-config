# Building Leeloo's ZMK Firmware
ZMK Firmware: [Introduction to ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/)
Installation: [Installing ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup)
Customization: [Customizing ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/customization)
Development Environment: [Basic Setup](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/setup)

Add nice!view support in the build.yaml file:
```
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: leeloo_left nice_view_adapter nice_view
```


## Building Leeloo's ZMK Firmware with nice!view Displays
There are a couple of files that need to be adjusted before the build commands can be run.

### Edit the leeloo[_rev2].keymap File
Near the top 3rd of the leeloo[_rev2].keymap file, locate the following code block:

```
//nice_view_spi: &spi0 {
//	cs-gpios = <&pro_micro 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
//};
```

Remove the forward slashes to resemble the following:
```
nice_view_spi: &spi0 {
	cs-gpios = <&pro_micro 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
};
```

Save your changes and commit the file. GH action will automatically build the firmware.
